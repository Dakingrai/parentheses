the accuracy of different models when promoting n important heads are as follows, where (number of head, accuracy). 

This is for three-paren GPT2-Small = [(0, 49.00), (5, 47.33), (10, 47.33), (20, ), (30, ), (40, ), (50, ), (60, ), (1xx, )], GPT2-Medium = [(0,), (5, ), (10, ), (20, ), (30, ), (40, ), (50, ), (60, ), (1xx, )], GPT2-Large = [(0,), (5, ), (10, ), (20, ), (30, ), (40, ), (50, ), (60, ), (1xx, )], GPT2-XL = [(0,), (5, ), (10, ), (20, ), (30, ), (40, ), (50, ), (60, ), (1xx, )]
